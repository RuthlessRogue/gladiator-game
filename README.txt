Gladiator

In order for Gladiator to properly funciton, the following must first
be done:
1. Two folders are created in the same directory as all class files
   one named "gameSaveFiles" and the other "opponentFiles".
2. the text files "commoner", "fighter", "gladiator", "grandChampion",
   "knight", and "peasant" must be placed within the previously created
   folder named "opponentFiles".
